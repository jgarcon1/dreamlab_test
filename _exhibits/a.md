François Duvalier’s regime had limited the flow of information, and fostered alienation and mistrust among different sectors of the population. Michel Rolp Trouillot argues that by “indiscriminately attacking groups that were not defined in political terms, and individuals who were thought to be political innocents, Duvalierist violence broke down the traditional solidarities within civil society.”

 Trouillot concludes that Duvalierist violence thus succeeded in casting a pall over most relationships.  I contend that François’s regime was sustained by its ability to alienate citizens from one another and hamper discourse across social, political, and geographic lines, while simultaneously advancing a singular vision of Haiti’s future. Contending discourses were thwarted by ingrained mistrust and this enabled Duvalierist discourse to circulate largely unchallenged.

Duvalierism blossomed because of this isolation-induced silence. Trouillot rightly argues, however, that Duvalierist discourse was only effective when it combined “practical consent with violence and auto-neutralization.”  Even without the wide circulation of competing ideologies, Duvalierism never arrived at full consensus, only “disapproving silence.”  The strategies employed by François Duvalier were more closely aligned with non-totalitarian despotism, particularly in its populist form.

Rather than eliminate democratic processes outright, Duvalier chose to operate parallel to these processes, and at times through the semblance that they were maintained. This provided the public with opportunities to exercise their recently acquired voting rights. For a large sector of the population, elections, referenda, and national rallies created new social roles; and such occasions interpellated long-marginalized peasants as active and engaged citizens. This made it impossible to opt out of politics. Now, all citizens were necessarily politically engaged ones; even those who abstained from voting and avoided rallies had, in essence, made a political choice.

The regime’s use of rallies and referenda suggests that Duvalier actively courted citizen engagement, even if the votes cast did not determine election outcomes. The illusion of popular support maintained his system of governance; the regime relied upon tacit consent, alongside violent coercion, to solicit a “seeming” compliance from the entire population.

As newspapers turned to investigative journalism, reporters were sent to the countryside to collect firsthand testimony and transmit information from the rural villages to urban city centers. As these reports verified longstanding rumors of pervasive poverty and lack of government redress, it became harder to attribute these condition to mere presidential inexperience.  In just a few years, the independent press had combatted regional isolation to unify citizens across the country against both government indifference to the socio-economic plight of most Haitians and the abusive use of paramilitary force. Retribution remained a real concern, leaving journalists and their editors to devise intricate reporting strategies to avoid the ire of the government.
